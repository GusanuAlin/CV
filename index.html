        <h1><em><strong>Summary:</em></strong></h1>
        <p>     Vital and intricate, the fields of business and IT constantly lay new
            grounds and set new standards for human progress. In a world
            where bleeding-edge technology is always around the corner,
            industries and businesses find themselves compelled to turn to
            computer scientists who can accurately take the pulse of markets
            and offer valuable expertise. During the past decades, business
            enterprises have been required to harness the numerous possibilities
            offered by computers, while also employing people with a particular
            skillset. Innovation, open-mindedness, attention to details, sharp
            intellect and concentration are but a few of the qualities that meet
            the profile of a computer scientist working in the business sector.
            With that in mind, I’m always looking forward to enhancing my skills
            throughout my education.
            I am an enthusiastic and open-minded student, always striving
            for more and I thoroughly enjoy teamwork, my life experiences
            being testament to this. I have been working even since I
            turned 16, so I am well acquainted with teamwork requirements.
            Working as bartender and head waiter helped me improve on my
            communication, teamwork and leadership skills while also showing
            me the value of punctuality and commitment.
            Studying mathematics at a high level has endowed me with a logical
            way of addressing real-life problems and the capacity to predict the
            outcome of any given situation. Moreover, interacting with thousands
            of people has allowed me to become a proficient negotiator and has
            given me a glimpse into what marketing is.
